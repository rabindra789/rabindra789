# Hello, world! 🌍

My name's **Rabindra** – a DevOps, Backend & Cybersecurity engineer in the making, currently pursuing my B.Tech.  
I spend most of my time exploring the **deep side of technology**, breaking systems apart, and learning how to secure them again. My goal? To protect data, strengthen defenses, and someday serve in **cyber forensics at the national level**.

I started my journey with Linux and networking, picked up Python for automation and security projects, and gradually expanded into DevOps, cloud, and forensics.  
I enjoy working on **security tools, automation scripts, and system-level projects** that challenge my curiosity.  

Outside of code, I like digging into cybersecurity case studies, experimenting with Linux internals, and (occasionally) gaming.  

📌 Feel free to explore my repositories — some of my favorite work is pinned below.  
Let’s build, break, and secure things together. 🔐

Thanks for stopping by, fellow explorer!
